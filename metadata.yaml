description: '"Dr. Moll is a gifted physician of long experience whose work with those
  problems of medicine and hygiene which demand scientific acquaintance with human
  nature has made him well known to experts in these fields. In this book he has undertaken
  to describe the origin and development, in childhood and youth, of the acts and
  feelings due to sex; to explain the forces by which sex-responses are directed and
  misdirected; and to judge the wisdom of existing and proposed methods of preventing
  the degradation of a child''s sexual life"--Introduction. (PsycINFO Database Record
